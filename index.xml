      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve got my hands on the craved-for IoT ESP32, thanks to DFRobot, and have been tinkering with it ever since. I&amp;rsquo;m really amazed by it since it packs both Bluetooth and WiFi in a small yet powerful unit. Since I received the MCU rather than the module, so, to use it, I made myself a breakout board named ESPer(because, why not? üòÑ). Feel free to check out its Instructable over here.</description>

      <description>A task came up in Google Code-in which asked me to install the django-netjsonconfig module by OpenWISP. Furthermore, I&amp;rsquo;m also supposed to share the challenges I faced during the set-up process as a sort of feedback. I&amp;rsquo;ll be trying be concise in this post so, without further ado, I&amp;rsquo;m beginning with this post.
Installing &amp;ldquo;django-netjsonconfig&amp;rdquo; The installation instructions for this this module have been well-documented on its GitHub repository. So I began the installation by creating a Python 2.</description>

      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been participating in Google Code-in which is Google&amp;rsquo;s initiative to introduce young minds to the concept of FOSS, that is Free or Open-Source Softwares. This post is for sharing my experiences with GCI, as the title suggests. So let&amp;rsquo;s just get on it.
It all began while I was returning from an outing on 5 December, 2017 and was searching the internet for Google Science Fair to check if I could participate in it or not.</description>

      <description>So, Who Am I? 
I‚Äôm just another person who likes writing, programming and making stuff. Even setting the title as Who Am I for this article is reminding me of whoami in Linux. I feel the inner urge to contribute something to the Internet because I love writing and I believe posting something online enables users all around the globe to see your work and suggest improvements.
Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve also started taking interest in web designing and hosting the fruitful results of which these site and blogs are!</description>
